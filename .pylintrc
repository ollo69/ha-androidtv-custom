[MESSAGES CONTROL]
# PyLint message control settings
# Reasons disabled:
# format - handled by black
# locally-disabled - it spams too much
# duplicate-code - unavoidable
# cyclic-import - doesn't test if both import on load
# abstract-class-little-used - prevents from setting right foundation
# unused-argument - generic callbacks and setup methods create a lot of warnings
# too-many-* - are not enforced for the sake of readability
# too-few-* - same as too-many-*
# abstract-method - with intro of async there are always methods missing
# inconsistent-return-statements - doesn't handle raise
# too-many-ancestors - it's too strict.
# wrong-import-order - isort guards this
# consider-using-f-string - str.format sometimes more readable
# ---
# Enable once current issues are fixed:
# consider-using-namedtuple-or-dataclass (Pylint CodeStyle extension)
# consider-using-assignment-expr (Pylint CodeStyle extension)
